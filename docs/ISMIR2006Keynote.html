Global Context: Policy Research Challenges<br>
</big><br>
ABSTRACT:
<br>
<br>
The history of past music technologies tells us that the specific
<br>
technical and legal frameworks for music distribution can have a major
<br>
impact on patterns of production and use. If we wish to ensure that
<br>
future music distribution maximizes public benefit, it is essential to
<br>
ensure that commercial interests and public interests are aligned
<br>
rather than juxtaposed. In assembling the music distribution systems of
<br>
the future, law-makers need to be able to draw on pertinent policy
<br>
research that identifies and explores the critical issues.
<br>
Unfortunately, little music policy research is being carried out.
<br>
Government, industry, academia, non-profit organizations and
<br>
international bodies have not yet risen to the policy challenges --
<br>
even as web-based music distribution systems appear. As a result, we
<br>
are in danger of creating ad hoc systems that fall short in serving the
<br>
public good, especially in a global context. In this presentation, I
<br>
identify some of the pertinent policy issues and discuss a values-based
<br>
approach to design.
