ISMIR 2006 Call for Submissions

ISMIR 2006 is the seventh international conference on Music Information
Retrieval and will be held at the Fairmont Empress Hotel in beautiful 
Victoria, Canada. The annual ISMIR Conference is the established
international forum for those working on accessing digital musical
material. It reflects the tremendous recent growth of music-related
data available and the consequent need to search within it to retrieve
music and musical information efficiently and effectively. These
concerns are of interest to academia, industry, entertainment, and
education. ISMIR therefore aims to provide a place for the exchange
and discussion of news, issues and results, by bringing together
researchers and developers, educators and librarians, students and
professional users, working in fields that contribute to this
multidisciplinary domain, to present original theoretical or practical
work. It also serves as a discussion forum, provides introductory and
in-depth information in specific domains, and showcases current
products and systems.
